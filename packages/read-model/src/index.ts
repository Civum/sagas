/**
 * Every read the experience layer does goes through here.
 *
 * Today these functions read fixture JSON off disk. That is a starting point,
 * not the design. Putting a real database behind them is the first
 * infrastructure job on this layer, and nothing that calls them changes when
 * you do, which is why they sit in one package.
 *
 * Two things import this and only two: `apps/web`, which calls it directly from
 * server components, and `apps/ui-api`, which exposes it over HTTP for the
 * browser. Server components should keep calling it directly. A server making a
 * network request to its own API to render a page is the classic mistake in this
 * shape.
 *
 * Rule: components take data as props. Pages and route handlers call these
 * functions and pass the result down. If you find yourself importing fixture
 * JSON inside a component, that is the mistake this package exists to prevent.
