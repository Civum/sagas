/**
 * Stand-ins for the sections and passages of a site's page.
 *
 * Nobody knows yet how claims become a readable page: which ones form a section,
 * what its heading says, or how the passage is written and kept coherent. That
 * is the intelligence layer's design work. The experience layer still has to
 * build the page now, so each site can carry invented sections here, the same
 * way `weight.ts` stands in for scoring. They are written by hand, per state,
 * and merged into the derived states by the reducer.
 *
 * Write a span by the phrase it covers, not by offsets. `span()` finds the
 * phrase and fails loudly if it is missing, so a passage can be edited without
 * recounting characters.
