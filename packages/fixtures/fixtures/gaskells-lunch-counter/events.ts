/**
 * Gaskell's Lunch Counter — contribution event log
 * ================================================
 *
 * A place that closed. Everybody who went there remembers it, nobody agrees on
 * when it shut, and the disagreement is about one date on an otherwise
 * well-supported claim.
 *
 * THIS CONTENT IS INVENTED, including the name of the business. The street
 * address and coordinates are a real corner in Boise. There was no Gaskell's
 * Lunch Counter there and there are no such people. The business name is
 * invented on purpose, so that a fabricated dispute about who owned a place
 * cannot be read onto anybody's actual family or actual shop.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SITE IS FOR
 *
 * The flagship site teaches the model through a community whose vocabulary a
 * reader has to learn first. This one teaches the same structures with a
 * subject nobody needs a glossary for. A lunch counter closed. People
 * disagree about the year.
 *
 * It exercises:
 *
 *   - One record producing several claims. The menu photograph is read three
 *     different ways by three people.
 *   - A dispute landing on one element while the rest of the claim stands.
 *     The closing year is contested. The address, the owners and the fire are
 *     not.
 *   - Corroboration counted by family line. Two of the contributors are
 *     siblings and share a `lineageId`, so their agreement is one source
 *     rather than two. A third is unrelated, and that is what moves the
 *     number.
 *   - A documentary source arriving late and contradicting the memory that
 *     everybody had agreed on.
 *
 * Authored as an append-only log. States are derived, never authored. See
 * ../../src/reduce.ts.
