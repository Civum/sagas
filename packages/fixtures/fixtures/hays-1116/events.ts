/**
 * 1116 Hays Street — contribution event log
 * =========================================
 *
 * The other half of the pair. Its neighbour at 1114 is a separate site about
 * twelve metres away. See that file for what the pair is for.
 *
 * THIS CONTENT IS INVENTED, including the business names. The street and the
 * coordinates are real. There were no such shops and there are no such people.
 *
 * This site also carries an unresolved cross-site reference. A claim here
 * points at the site next door, because the two shops shared a wall and
 * somebody remembers the doorway between them. Nothing in the model resolves
 * that pointer into anything, which is deliberate and is asked about in
 * `docs/DESIGN-QUESTIONS.md` under "How does a reference become an edge?"
 *
 * Authored as an append-only log. States are derived, never authored. See
 * ../../src/reduce.ts.
