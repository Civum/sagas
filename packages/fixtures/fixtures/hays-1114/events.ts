/**
 * 1114 Hays Street — contribution event log
 * =========================================
 *
 * One half of a pair. Its neighbour at 1116 is a separate site about twelve
 * metres away, which is close enough that the two markers collide at most zoom
 * levels.
 *
 * THIS CONTENT IS INVENTED, including the business names. The street and the
 * coordinates are real. There were no such shops and there are no such people.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PAIR IS FOR
 *
 * The fixtures README lists "two places close enough together to collide as
 * map markers" as a situation nothing covers. This pair covers it.
 *
 * Two things follow from that and both are the experience layer's problem.
 * Markers this close have to resolve into something a person can choose
 * between rather than one marker silently on top of another. And the two sites
 * are genuinely separate places with separate records, so merging them to
 * tidy the map would be wrong.
 *
 * The pair also shares a contributor with the lunch counter site, which is the
 * only way a contributor view has more than one place in it.
 *
 * Authored as an append-only log. States are derived, never authored. See
 * ../../src/reduce.ts.
