/**
 * The corner shop — sections and passages
 * =======================================
 *
 * INVENTED STAND-INS. Nothing here is derived from the event log. These are the
 * sections and passages a page can expect once the intelligence layer produces
 * them, written by hand so the page can be built now. See ../../src/narrative.ts.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SHOWS
 *
 *   - t0 has no sections. A photograph with nothing claimed about it has no
 *     passage to write. The page shows the record on its own.
 *   - From t1, a passage whose phrases lead back to the claim and to the detail
 *     each phrase is about.
 *   - At t2 the year is disputed, and the passage says "sometime in the 1950s",
 *     which both readings fit. Selecting it leads to the date detail, where
 *     both readings sit side by side. The passage does not pick one.
 *   - At t2 one phrase leads to two claims: the owner's name comes from the
 *     first claim, and the relative's extension adds to it.
 *   - At t3 a second section, for the sign. One of its spans points at a whole
 *     claim with no detail, so both forms of span appear.
