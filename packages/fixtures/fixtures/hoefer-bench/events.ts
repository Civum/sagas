/**
 * The Hoefer bench — contribution event log
 * =========================================
 *
 * A place with one claim on it and nobody else has been near it. That is the
 * whole point of this site.
 *
 * THIS CONTENT IS INVENTED, including the name on the plaque. The path and the
 * coordinates are real. There is no such bench and no such person.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SITE IS FOR
 *
 * Most places in a real archive look like this, and for a long time. One
 * person, one contribution, nothing corroborated, an integrity score in the
 * low twenties. An interface that renders it in red, or as an empty state, or
 * as an error, tells the person who just contributed that their contribution
 * failed. It did not. It is early.
 *
 * This site exists so that failure is reachable in one click rather than
 * something a developer has to imagine. Acceptance case:
 * `sparse-site-is-not-empty-site`.
 *
 * It also covers "a place with exactly one claim and no contributors beyond
 * its author", which the fixtures README lists as uncovered.
 *
 * Authored as an append-only log. States are derived, never authored. See
 * ../../src/reduce.ts.
