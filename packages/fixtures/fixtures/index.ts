/**
 * Every site the fixtures hold.
 *
 * One entry per directory under `fixtures/`. Adding a site means writing its
 * event log and adding a line here. Nothing else in the package needs to know
 * the site exists.
 *
 * `example-site` is the flagship. It is the richest log, it carries the
 * translation and rendering cases, and it is the one to read first. The others
 * exist so that the map has more than one pin, so that "everything within two
 * kilometres" has something to find, and so that a contributor can appear in
 * more than one place.
