/**
 * The home page. A map, and one place.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * READ THIS ONE, THEN DO THE NEXT FIVE.
 *
 * This page is the worked example: data comes from one place, gets passed down
 * as props, and the components that render it are finished rather than stubbed.
 * Three of them are done: `MapUnavailable`, `IntegrityBadge` and
 * `ConfidenceIndicator`. Everything else in `src/features` is one line and a TODO.
 *
 * Doing one of those is a well-shaped first task. Open the stub, read the
 * comment, look at the acceptance case it names, and build it the way these
 * three are built.
 *
 * THE SHAPE WORTH COPYING
 *
 * The page reads data. The components do not. That is what lets the same
 * components render against four different fixture states on /dev, and it is
 * what will let them render against a database later without changing.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE
 *
 * A design. Grey text on white with system fonts is a placeholder and the
 * visual identity is your deliverable. Replace all of it.
 *
 * The map. `MapView` is a stub. Integrating Mapbox is the centrepiece of this
 * layer and doing it for you would take the most interesting work in the scope.
