 * A claim given in another language, and how it's been rendered into English.
 *
 * TODO: three states to handle, and the first is the one people forget.
 *
 * - No rendering yet. The claim is pinned, readable in the original, and
 *   `text` is empty. Show the original. Show that a rendering is wanted. Do not
 *   hide it, do not sort it to the bottom, do not render an empty row.
 * - One rendering. Show it, credited, with the original reachable.
 * - Several renderings. They coexist. None is the correct one. If someone has
 *   objected that a rendering loses something, that objection stays attached to
 *   both versions.
 *
 * A reader who speaks no Euskara should still be able to see that two people
 * disagree about what a sentence means.
 *
 * Acceptance criterions: claim-outside-the-graph, rendering-arrives,
 * coexisting-renderings.
