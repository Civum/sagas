/**
 * How well supported one claim is.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * WORKED EXAMPLE, like IntegrityBadge. Copy the structure. The styling is a
 * placeholder to replace.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * WHY AN AFFIRMATION COUNT IS NEVER SHOWN ON ITS OWN
 *
 * An affirmation is not corroboration.
 *
 * A claim can have five affirmations and zero independent support, because
 * agreeing is not bringing anything. Support comes from somebody else putting a
 * record of their own behind the claim. Five people saying "sounds right" is
 * five reactions to one source.
 *
 * So this never shows an affirmation count on its own. "5 agree" next to
 * "single source" looks like a contradiction, and "5 agree" without the
 * qualifier reads as support that is not there.
 *
 * `cl-afterhours` at t3 is the case: two affirmations, zero independent
 * sources, still single_source. Open `pnpm inspect --state t3 cl-afterhours`
 * and look.
 *
 * Acceptance criterion: affirmation-without-independence.
 *
 * WHY "CONTESTED" IS NOT RED
 *
 * This project reads "contested" as a sign that a claim matters enough for
 * somebody to argue. Nothing here should make it look like a failure, which is
 * why there is no red.
 *
 * TODO for whoever takes this further: a historian probably wants something
 * subtler than a label, which they can take in while skimming a paragraph
 * without the page looking like a dashboard. Margin marks, a weight in the
 * type or something on hover are all options. This version gets the rule right
 * and is not the finished design.
