/**
 * The places, as a list.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * WORKED EXAMPLE. Built rather than stubbed, and not as a consolation prize.
 *
 * Two reasons this ships whether or not there is a map:
 *
 * 1. A map alone is unusable with a screen reader. This list is how the same
 *    information reaches somebody who cannot see it, so it is part of the
 *    WCAG 2.1 AA requirement rather than a fallback for a missing token.
 * 2. Anybody can work on the whole application without registering for
 *    anything. Nobody is blocked waiting on a Mapbox account.
 *
 * It renders when there is no token, and it should keep rendering when there is
 * one, whether beside the map or behind a toggle.
 *
 * Docs:
 *   Lists and semantics   https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/page-structure/content/
 *   Tailwind utilities    https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first
